# Spaceship Titanic - Machine Learning Classification 🚀

This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether a passenger was transported on the **Spaceship Titanic**. The dataset comes from Kaggle's Spaceship Titanic competition.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
The Spaceship Titanic encountered a mysterious anomaly and many passengers were transported to an alternate dimension! The goal is to **predict whether passengers were transported or not**, based on features like age, spending, and cabin location.
